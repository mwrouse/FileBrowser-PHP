<b>Description</b><br/>
This file (index.php) will allow you to browse a directory, navigate all subdirectories and files all in one simple script.

<b>Important:</b><br/>
The .htaccess file needs to be in the directory!<br/>

This is designed to go in a root directory, so if you need to use it in a sub directory you can either create a subdomain to point to that directory or modify the file.


<b>Demo:</b><br/>
